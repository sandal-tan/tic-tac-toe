# ReasonML - React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

In order to teach myself ReasonML and React at the same time, I am walking through the
[React Tic Tac Toe Tutoria]l(https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) in order to
get up to speed.

As I had trouble finding helpful ReasonML + ReasonReact tutorials, I hope that this helps
others get a footing, as it was been a helpful process for me.
